Task 1

This is task 1 where we build a Google Details card using HTML and CSS.
In this project, I created a simple profile card webpage using HTML and CSS. The HTML structure begins with the standard DOCTYPE declaration and includes sections for the page’s title, which I set as "Google." I linked an external CSS file to separate the design from the content.

The main content is placed inside a parent div with the class .parent-div. It contains the Google logo, the name “Ranesh Suthar,” a profession description as “Designer . Engineer,” followed by social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and a call-to-action button labeled "Add me to search."

In the CSS, I set a soft blue background for the page (rgb(212, 231, 246) and used flexbox to center the content both vertically and horizontally. The .parent-div has a light blue background, rounded corners, and a shadow for a modern look. I ensured the Google logo, headings, and social media icons are aligned neatly within the parent div. The social media icons are displayed side by side, each with a fixed size. The button at the bottom is styled with rounded corners, a white background, and black text for a clean, professional appearance.

This project provides a visually appealing, centered layout with minimalistic design elements.

In this project, I created a shopping interface using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean, responsive layout. The structure is divided into two main parts: a navigation bar and a content area with account details and an order summary.

HTML Structure:
I started by designing the navigation bar (.nav), which includes a logo, navigation links (Home, Shop, Contact, Help), a dropdown for account options, a cart icon showing the number of items, and a profile image. Below the navigation, I built the main content in two sections:

Account Details (.child1): This section has a form for user login, with fields for email and password, and buttons for login and account registration. Additionally, it includes sections for Account, Shipping, and Payment.
Order Summary (.child2): This section displays the current order, including an image of Sony headphones, product description, price, quantity adjustments, and a cost breakdown showing subtotal, tax, shipping, and the total.
CSS Styling:
Using Flexbox, I ensured the layout was well-aligned and responsive. The buttons are styled with rounded corners, and the input fields have padding and soft colors for a user-friendly experience. Overall, the interface is designed to be simple, organized, and visually appealing, with a focus on ease of navigation and interaction.

In this project, I created a clean, responsive landing page with a focus on remote work solutions. The design is split into two main sections: a navigation bar and a hero section with accompanying content.

HTML Structure:
I started with a fixed navigation bar (.nav) that includes a logo, navigation links (Features, Company, Careers, About), and two buttons for "Login" and "Register." Each of the dropdown links, such as "Features" and "Company," has icons for dropdown functionality, along with an arrow-up image to show interaction.

In the main content (.parent), I added two sections:

Hero Section (.hero1): A headline ("Make remote work"), a brief description, and a call-to-action button ("Learn more"). Below that, I displayed a row of company logos to enhance brand credibility.
Image Section (.hero2): This section includes a hero image (image-hero-desktop.png), which visually complements the text.
CSS Styling:
Using flexbox, I made the layout responsive. The navigation is styled to remain fixed at the top, and the buttons have hover effects for better interaction. The hero section has bold typography and a contrasting black button with white text, which changes on hover. Flexbox ensures that the content and images are well-aligned and balanced. Overall, the design is simple, clean, and professional, with a focus on usability and aesthetic appeal.


Task 4

In this project, I designed a visually appealing blog post layout using HTML and CSS. The content is structured using a grid system, with different sections showcasing various articles and individuals.

HTML Structure:
I created five main sections (div1 to div5), each containing an image and a title (h2) with accompanying text. These sections cover different topics, from a book feature to profiles of notable figures like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, and Alex Hormozi. Each section also has its own background color for distinction.

CSS Styling:
I implemented a grid layout for the container, dividing it into four columns and two rows. This allows the content to be arranged in a structured yet flexible way. Some sections span multiple columns or rows, adding variety to the design. Each section has rounded corners (border-radius: 30px) for a polished look.

I used flexbox in some parts of the design (e.g., .img1) to align the images and text properly. The images are circular with a consistent height, and each section has a distinct background color to differentiate the content while maintaining a cohesive style.

The overall design is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, with a focus on readability and aesthetic appeal.
