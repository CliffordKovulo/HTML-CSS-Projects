          “This Norwegian exposition on death and loss almost defies
          description. It is mesmeric and obtuse, alarming and atmospheric, and
          ultimately peaceful and unresolved — much like death and loss
          themselves. A child mourning her younger brother ventures into a wood
          with her brother’s spirit (?) in tow, passing creatures familiar and
          menacing, to arrive in the presence of a lake-bound lady who recounts
          their story. The scratchy black-and-white figures move through dark,
          densely colored landscapes full of inexplicable detail on a propulsive
          quest for something, a hurried passage through the hardest part of
          their story, to come out the other side. Torseter’s imagery defines
          their journey, indelibly imprinting on the reader myriad confounding
          and consuming emotions, in tension with one another. We are left with
          many questions, but beneath them a definite sense of
          it’s-going-to-be-okay. This is what art is for.” — Calling Caldecott

          Born and raised in South Africa, Musk spent time in Canada before
          moving to the United States. Educated at the University of
          Pennsylvania in physics and business, Musk started getting his feet
          wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes like Zip2 and
          X.com, which merged with a company that became PayPal.

          Warren buffett’s birthday present arrived early this year. On August
          28th, two days before America Inc’s favourite great-grandpa turned 94,
          his bricks-to-motor-insurance conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway,
          reached a market value of $1trn. It became only the eighth American
          company to claim that title and, as a child of the Nebraskan
          heartland, the first not to emerge from the west-coast tech scene. Its
          class-A shares now change hands for $715,000, 55,000 times what they
          were worth when Mr Buffett took control of a struggling textile mill
          in 1965. In that period the total return, including dividends, of the
          S&P 500 index of America’s biggest firms has risen just 400-fold. When
          Berkshire’s longtime shareholders wish Mr Buffett many happy returns,
          his customarily folksy response might be: right back at ya.

          Oracle Corporation was founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner,
          and Ed Oates. The company's first product was the Oracle Database, the
          first commercially available relational database management system to
          use SQL. Over the years, Oracle has grown through internal development
          and acquisitions.

          Alex Hormozi is a first-generation Iranian-American entrepreneur,
          investor, and philanthropist. In 2013, he started his first brick &
          mortar business. Within three years, he successfully scaled his
          business to six locations. He then sold his locations to transition to
          the turnaround business. From there he spent two years turning 32+
          brick & mortar businesses around using the same model that made his
          privately owned locations successful. After that experience, he
          packaged his process into a licensing model which scaled to over 4000+
          locations in 4 years. Over that same four-year period, he founded and
          scaled three other companies to $120M+ in cumulative sales across four
          different industries (software, service, e-commerce, and brick &
          mortar) without taking on outside capital. He has scaled and exited 7
          companies. His most notable exit was his majority sale of his
          licensing company for $46.2M in 2021.
